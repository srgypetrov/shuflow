# Shuflow

Shuflow is a web-based music player that enables random playback across your entire Spotify library. It addresses the limitation of Spotify's native application, which doesn't provide functionality for shuffling through a user's complete collection of liked content. The application fetches all liked tracks, albums, artists, and playlists from a user's Spotify library and implements true random playback across this content.

A Spotify Premium account is required to use this application.
